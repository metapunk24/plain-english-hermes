# Plain English Copywriting

## Overview

Plain English means communication whose wording, structure, and design are so clear that the intended audience can **easily find what they need, understand what they find, and use that information** (PLAIN definition, 2014).

This skill helps you rewrite foggy, jargon-filled, or bureaucratic text into clear, direct prose. It works for emails, reports, web pages, legal documents, instructions, customer letters, and any other essential information.

**When to use:**
- User says: "rewrite this clearly", "simplify", "make this plain English", "улучши текст", "перепиши яснее", "remove jargon"
- Any text feels wordy, abstract, passive, or confusing
- Before publishing anything meant for a general audience

**Standard output — two documents:**
1. **The rewritten text** — clean, plain-English version, ready to use
2. **The change report** — standalone audit explaining every significant edit, the principle applied, and the before/after comparison

Always produce both documents when feasible. If the user only wants one, ask which, but default to both.

**Core philosophy (from Martin Cutts):**
> "Plain English is an attitude. It's about caring enough about your readers to express your message simply and directly."

## The Twelve Main Principles (Quick Reference)

These 12 principles are the backbone of every rewrite:

1. **Plan before you write** — know your purpose, audience, and key message.
2. **Organize for the reader** — put what matters most first; use a logical flow.
3. **Use short sentences** — aim for 15–20 words average; one thought per sentence.
4. **Prefer plain words** — use "buy" not "purchase", "help" not "assist", "about" not "approximately".
5. **Write concisely** — cut every unnecessary word; if in doubt, leave it out.
6. **Use active voice** — "The team completed the report" not "The report was completed by the team."
7. **Choose vigorous verbs** — avoid weak noun phrases like "conduct an investigation" → "investigate".
8. **Use vertical lists** — break complex information into bullet points for scannability.
9. **Convert negatives to positives** — say what IS possible, not what isn't.
10. **Punctuate properly** — commas, periods, and dashes guide the reader's eye and mind.
11. **Use good grammar** — errors undermine credibility.
12. **Proofread** — read aloud, check dates, names, numbers, and consistency.

## How to Use This Skill

When a user asks you to rewrite something in plain English, follow this 3-step workflow:

### Step 1: Diagnose the Fog

Analyze the original text against these diagnostic questions:

| Problem | Diagnostic Question |
|---------|-------------------|
| Sentence bloat | Are sentences averaging over 20 words? |
| Passive fog | Can you add "by zombies" after the verb? (passive test) |
| Noun strings | Are there 3+ nouns in a row? (e.g., "service delivery optimization strategy") |
| Jargon | Would a non-expert understand every term? |
| Abstract nouns | Are concrete actions hidden inside nouns? (e.g., "implementation" → "implement") |
| Negative framing | Does the text say what NOT to do instead of what TO do? |
| Weak verbs | Are strong verbs turned into noun + weak verb? (e.g., "make a decision" → "decide") |
| Missing lists | Could a paragraph be a bulleted list? |
| Over-formality | Would the writer say this face-to-face? |

### Step 2: Rewrite

Apply the principles above. Prioritize in this order:
1. Fix sentence length (split long sentences)
2. Switch passive → active voice
3. Replace abstract/jargon words with plain alternatives
4. Break dense paragraphs into lists
5. Convert negatives to positives
6. Trim redundant words

### Step 3: Produce Two Deliverables

Always produce two separate documents unless the user explicitly asks for only one:

**Document 1 — Rewritten Text**
Clean, plain-English version, ready to replace the original. No inline annotations, no explanations inside the text.

**Document 2 — Change Report (standalone audit)**
A separate explanation of every significant change, structured as:

```
### Change Report

**Scope:** [what was rewritten]
**Audience:** [who will read it]
**Overall improvement:** [one-sentence summary]

| # | Original | Rewritten | Principle | Why it helps the reader |
|---|----------|-----------|-----------|------------------------|
| 1 | ... | ... | Active voice | Removes hidden actor, shows who does what |
| 2 | ... | ... | Plain words | Replaces jargon with everyday language |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Metrics before vs. after:**
- Sentence length: X → Y words average
- Reading age: X → Y
- Active voice: X% → Y%

**Unresolved decisions / user choices needed:**
- [List any points where the user must decide, e.g. "Should we keep the legal term 'indemnify' or replace it with 'compensate'?"]
```

Present both documents in full. Do not merge them into one.

## Output Format Template

Use this structure for every plain-English rewrite. Produce **two separate documents**:

---

### Document 1 — Rewritten Text

```markdown
### Diagnosis (brief)
- **Sentence length:** X words average (target: 15–20)
- **Voice:** mostly passive/active (target: active)
- **Reading level:** approx. X (target: age 13 for general audience)
- **Main issues:** [list top 3 problems]

### Clean Version
[The full rewritten text, plain English only, no annotations]
```

**Exporting to .docx:**
If the user requests a Word document, save the clean version as Markdown first, then run:
```bash
python scripts/docx-export.py input.md output.docx
```
Requires `python-docx` (`pip install python-docx`).

---

### Document 2 — Change Report

```markdown
### Change Report

**Scope:** [what was rewritten]
**Audience:** [who will read it]
**Overall improvement:** [one-sentence summary]

| # | Original | Rewritten | Principle | Why it helps the reader |
|---|----------|-----------|-----------|------------------------|
| 1 | ... | ... | Active voice | ... |
| 2 | ... | ... | Plain words | ... |
| 3 | ... | ... | Short sentences | ... |

**Metrics before vs. after:**
- Sentence length: X → Y words average
- Reading age: X → Y
- Active voice: X% → Y%

**User decisions needed:**
- [Any points requiring user choice]

### If You Want to Go Further
- [Load thirty-guidelines.md for all 30 detailed rules]
- [Load examples-bank.md for categorized before/after examples]
- [Load quick-checklist.md for a 20-point self-review]
```

**Default rule:** Always deliver both documents. Only deliver one if the user explicitly says "just give me the rewritten text" or "just give me the change report."

## Special Cases

### Legal Language
- Use "plain legal English" — clarity without losing precision
- Define necessary technical terms on first use
- Use definitions sections for unavoidable jargon
- Keep sentence structure parallel in lists and conditions

### Low-Literacy Readers
- Use reading-age 9–11 text
- Short words (1–2 syllables preferred)
- Concrete examples, not abstractions
- Visual aids, white space, large fonts
- See chapter 29 in thirty-guidelines.md

### Email
- Subject line = main message
- Opening sentence = what you want
- One request per email when possible
- Use bullet points for multiple items

### Web Content
- Front-load: most important info first
- Chunk content: short paragraphs, frequent headings
- Use links, not cross-references
- Write for scanners (bold keywords, lists)

## Key Metrics

- **Target sentence length:** 15–20 words average
- **Target reading age:** 13 for general UK/US adult audience
- **Target active voice ratio:** >70%
- **Maximum noun string length:** 2 nouns (3+ is "knotty")

## Quick Fog Tests

**Zombie Test for Passive Voice:**
Can you insert "by zombies" after the verb? If yes, it's passive.
> "The report was completed [by zombies]" → PASSIVE → "The team completed the report"

**Noun String Counter:**
Count nouns in a row. 3+ = fog alert.
> "service delivery optimization strategy" = 4 nouns → "strategy for optimizing service delivery"

**Talk Test:**
Would you say this out loud to a colleague? If it sounds ridiculous spoken, it's probably written fog.

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Premature completion.** Do not declare a rewrite "done" until the change log explains every significant edit against a specific principle.
2. **Over-simplification.** Plain English is not baby talk. Technical terms are fine when the audience is specialist — define them for mixed audiences instead of deleting them.
3. **Passive voice tunnel vision.** Not every passive is bad. "The report was completed on time" is acceptable when the actor is unknown or unimportant. Fix only the ones that hide responsibility or confuse agency.
4. **Noun string blindness.** Three or more nouns in a row (e.g., "service delivery optimization strategy") create instant fog. Break them into prepositional phrases or verb clauses.
5. **Negative framing by default.** Writers often say what is NOT allowed. Flip to what IS allowed: "You cannot submit after Friday" → "Submit by Friday."
6. **Forgetting the reader.** Plain English is reader-centred. What is plain to scientists may be obscure to the public. Match complexity to audience literacy (see chapter 29 for low-literacy guidance).
7. **OCR blind trust.** When extracting text from PDFs via tools like `markitdown`, verify chapter titles and key terms against the table of contents. Absurd outputs like "Czech" instead of "check" signal OCR errors that will pollute your knowledge base if uncaught.
8. **Wrong file format assumption.** Tools like `markitdown` and `textract` often support `.docx` but not legacy `.doc` (Word 97-2003). If the user provides `.doc`, ask them to save as `.docx` or `.pdf` first, or warn that extraction may fail.
9. **Single-document output.** Users frequently expect two artifacts — the rewritten text plus a standalone change report — but only receive one merged document. Always default to dual output; only deliver one document if the user explicitly asks for it.
